# About Me

My name is Willie Jiang and I am a third year Computer Science major at UC Irvine. I have experience with a variety of programming languages including Python, Java, C++, Javascript, iOS development, and front end development, and have so far focused on personal projects. In the coming summer, I will be honing my skills further as a Data Science Engineer intern at Apple.


## Teaching Philosophy

Growing up in Silicon Valley, I was surrounded by evlolving technology during my childhood. I really enjoyed the introductory classes I took in high school. However, I really fell in love with programming once I started making projects on my own outside of school. What I love about programming is how it is a tool for me to create things that help me and the people around me. I hope to share this passion with my students and inspire them to create their own projects.

Throughout my years as both a teacher and a student, I have come to understand that the hands-on approach to learning programming is the best method of learning. Memorization and reciation is something that simply does not help with programming. I *highly* encourage students to take risks and explore their curiosity through experimentation and problem-solving. Writing and experimenting with their own code is the best way for a student to learn the ins and outs of a programming language. Teaching students how to learn will be a focal point of this course. This is because once a student has a basic understanding, they can easily branch out and learn other topics that interest them such as web scraping, app development, and front-end development.

Due to the hands-on nature of programming, I have chosen not to test students with exams. I believe that students learn best when playing around with code and learning from their mistakes. Additionally, the one on one aspect of the course allows me to facilitate a student's learning and encourage them to make these mistakes. Additionally, I have planned for students to make a personal project towards the end of the course. This will be an opportunity for students to branch out of their comfort zone and make a project on their own. I want to give students the chance to combine programming with their other interests. 


## Experience

My first experience with teaching was in the summer of 2017. I volunteered as a teaching assistant at a summer camp called Math Enrichment. Though I taught basic third grade math, I learned a lot from this experience and realized that teaching was something I thoroughly enjoyed. From 2018-2020, I worked at a local after school for math called Mathnasium. Here I taught levels of math K-12 and learned how to work individually with students. Most recently, I was a learning assistant for the introductory programming class (ICS 31) offered at UC Irvine. This was my first experience teaching programming, but I enjoyed it much more than teaching math as I felt that I was making a bigger impact. However, I felt frustrated when I felt that I did not have enough time to work with all the students that needed help. This is the reason why this course takes on a one-on-one tutoring format!
<!-- Whether you write your book's content in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or
in regular markdown files (`.md`), you'll write in the same flavor of markdown
called **MyST Markdown**.
This is a simple file to help you get started and show off some syntax.

## What is MyST?

MyST stands for "Markedly Structured Text". It
is a slight variation on a flavor of markdown called "CommonMark" markdown,
with small syntax extensions to allow you to write **roles** and **directives**
in the Sphinx ecosystem.

For more about MyST, see [the MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html).

## Sample Roles and Directives

Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They
are kind of like functions, but written in a markup language. They both
serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas
**directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,
and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive
that is being called.

Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.


## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
