Intro To Programming
============================

## Course Overview

Welcome to my introductory programming course! I have designed this course for people who have never had any programming experience. As such, I will be teaching this course using Python as it is most suitable for beginners. The focus will be on introducing the core concepts of programming and developing problem-solving skills, rather than delving into technical aspects of the language.

		
### Learning Objectives
		
At the end of this course, students should be able to:
		
* Understand the basic syntax and structure of the Python programming language
* Write basic programs using variables, loops, and control flow
* Implement basic object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes and objects
* Distinguish and use basic data types such as strings, integers, and lists
* Debug and test their code in Python
* Design and create their own projects in Python

Most importantly, it is my goal to equip students with the tools and knowledge to continue their programming journey independently and with confidence.


### Exams

Due to the hands-on nature of programming, exams are not necessary for learning programming. I believe that studnets learn best when playing around with code and learning from their mistakes. Additionally, the one on one aspect of the course allows me to facilitate a student's learning and encourage them to make these mistakes.


#### Homework

Homework will be assigned to students after every lesson and can be accessed on this website. The homework is designed not to teach, but to reinforce previous knowledge and encourage creativity.

### Personal Project

Towards the end of this course, students will work on a personal project of their choice. After learning HTTP requests and REST APIs student should be able to create a program that relates to themselves and their own hobbies. Guidance and advice will be provided to the student. Upon completion of this project, students should feel comfortable learning and creating projects on their own in the future.
